# CareersHub

CareersHub is a Job Search web application currently serving jobs from [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/jobs) (and soon from [GitHub](https://jobs.github.com/)).

Front-end is built with [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular.js) and [Bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma). Back-end uses [Node Express](https://expressjs.com/) as a Web Server and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to store data.

Feel free to fork the project, seed the database with your own data and extend user interface as you wish.
